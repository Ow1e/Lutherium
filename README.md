# Lutherium
NOTE: This a tool box project used by AIRSupport3. AIRSupport3 is a closed source project but Lutherium is not.

A way to create decentralized applications and databases using **Genesis Nodes** as a host dealer. I recommend using RSA to ensure your netwprl data is not tampered if it is open. If you want a closed system use a firewall and only allow your Nodes.
## Network Syncing
Always remember to connect to a trusted base node, bad nodes can lead you too different networks and can suggest peers to you. Network is only made for private systems as theres no node vertification in the network (would have to be deployed on the network).
## SubNetworks
Subnetworks are the sub branches of your own network. The Lutherium network can have subnets which can have different properties in the client while still all conecting together.
## How it can change
Right now the network still needs a "bookmark" (IP and Port) to connect to the right subnetwork. The bookmark can go offline but should probably use a address scheme to show who is who. All clients are currently forks of the connected genesis (forked or unforked) node which means if you join a node that is part of another network the node you are connecting to has to guide you through the network.
